# Migration Guide for Pending Features

This guide provides information about upcoming features and changes from open pull requests that may require migration steps or configuration updates.

## Open Pull Requests Overview

### PR #53: 【Feat】Automate Docker Image Builds with GitHub Actions
**Status:** Open  
**Source:** Fork from QwertyJack/claude-code (branch: main)

#### Summary of Changes
- Introduces a new GitHub Actions workflow to automate Docker image builds
- Adds workflow file (`.github/workflows/docker-build.yml` or similar)
- Configures automatic triggers on branch updates for continuous integration

#### New Configuration
- **GitHub Actions Workflow:** Automatic Docker image builds on push events
- **Build Process:** Based on existing GitHub Action templates for Docker

#### Installation/Usage Instructions
1. Once merged, Docker images will be automatically built on every push to the main branch
2. No manual configuration required - workflow is self-contained
3. Check GitHub Actions tab for build status and logs

#### Impact Assessment
- **Positive:** Ensures Docker images are always up-to-date with latest code
- **Risk:** Potential build failures if Dockerfile has issues
- **Testing:** Push a commit to observe workflow execution

### PR #52: feat: add shell completions (bash, zsh, fish)
**Status:** Open  
**Source:** Fork from gitmpr/claude-code (branch: feat/shell-completion-scripts)

#### Summary of Changes
- Adds static completion scripts for tab autocompletion
- Creates three shell completion files:
  - `shell-completions/claude-completions.bash`
  - `shell-completions/claude-completions.zsh`
  - `shell-completions/claude-completions.fish`

#### Important Notes
- Upstream integration isn't possible (client is not open source)
- These are static completion scripts, not integrated with the `claude` binary
- Typical modern CLI tools would support: `source <(claude completion $SHELL)`

#### Installation Instructions
1. Manual sourcing required for each shell:
   - **Bash:** `source /path/to/shell-completions/claude-completions.bash`
   - **Zsh:** `source /path/to/shell-completions/claude-completions.zsh`
   - **Fish:** `source /path/to/shell-completions/claude-completions.fish`
2. Add to shell configuration files for persistence

#### Configuration Requirements
- Users must manually source the appropriate completion script
- No automatic shell detection or integration

#### Impact Assessment
- **Positive:** Adds tab completion support for all major shells
- **Limitation:** Manual setup required vs. integrated completion
- **Usability:** Improves developer experience for power users

### PR #51: Enhance Statsig event logging in GitHub workflows
**Status:** Open  
**Source:** Fork from alokdangre/claude-code (branch: demo)

#### Summary of Changes
- Enhances Statsig event logging in GitHub workflows
- Logs additional events for issue management:
  - When issues are closed as duplicates
  - When duplicate comments are added
- Ensures consistency with existing logging patterns

#### Configuration Changes
- Updates existing GitHub workflow configurations
- Adds new event tracking for duplicate issue management

#### Usage Instructions
- Automatic integration with existing workflows
- No user action required
- Provides better analytics for issue management patterns

#### Impact Assessment
- **Positive:** Improved analytics and tracking of issue resolution patterns
- **Maintenance:** Consistent with existing logging patterns
- **Generated by:** Claude Code (as noted in PR description)

## Migration Recommendations

### Priority Order
1. **PR #52 (Shell Completions)** - User-facing feature with immediate usability impact
2. **PR #53 (Docker Automation)** - Infrastructure improvement with CI/CD benefits
3. **PR #51 (Statsig Logging)** - Analytics enhancement with minimal user impact

### Testing Considerations
- **Shell Completions:** Test across different shell environments (Bash, Zsh, Fish)
- **Docker Builds:** Verify Dockerfile compatibility and build success
- **Event Logging:** Confirm Statsig integration and data accuracy

### Rollout Strategy
1. Merge shell completions first for user experience improvements
2. Follow with Docker automation for infrastructure stability
3. Implement enhanced logging for better analytics

## Compatibility Notes
- All PRs are from forks and may require review for integration compatibility
- No breaking changes identified in any of the pending PRs
- Each PR addresses a distinct area (user experience, infrastructure, analytics)
